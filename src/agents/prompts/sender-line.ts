// principal), so it states it.

//   - A non-principal's descriptive role sat in the same parentheses as "(principal)", so
//     a contact whose job title is "Principal" rendered exactly like the principal. The
//     role is now labelled, and every non-principal line carries NOT_PRINCIPAL_LINE.
//   - An unresolved sender gets no "Current sender" line at all, only the LOW-TRUST
//     block; UNRESOLVED_SENDER_HEAD states the audience there.
